#### notes

- app.get(route, request handler)
- route parameteres
- query parameteres?
- post method
- patch request -> update partial field
- put request -> update entire field
- delete request
- middleware
- why again make server side (say form) validation? because client side validation can be tampered
- express validator
- query validator and body validator
- organise your endpoints using routers
